### v1.0.0-beta.0 (Aug 14, 2024)

:tada: Exciting Announcement: Now Supports SwiftUI! :partying_face:

We're thrilled to introduce the latest version of SendbirdSwiftUI, bringing modern SwiftUI support to our popular Chat SDK!

Our previous UIKit-based SDK allowed for rapid UI integration and simple customization. Now, we're extending these benefits to SwiftUI, the cutting-edge framework for building user interfaces.

We offer the same level of features with our UIKit SDK.
